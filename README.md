Performance
===

An example of a test harness using benchmark.js to test various strategies.

Currently in the process of adding strategies and their test files.

The key issues to consider:
* Does the code under test cache results in some way
* Does each implementation acheive the same results (see unit tests)
* Does the test reflect usage within the application
